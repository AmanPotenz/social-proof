## How the System Works

### For In-Memory Testing (Fast UI Testing)
```
Developer clicks "Add Test Payment"
    ↓
/api/test-payment creates random fake payment
    ↓
Added to in-memory store (paymentsStore)
    ↓
GET /api/payments returns in-memory data
    ↓
Frontend displays notification
```
**Note**: In-memory data is lost on server restart - use only for UI testing

### For Real Stripe Payments (Production Flow)
```
Customer completes Stripe checkout
    ↓
Stripe sends webhook to /api/webhook
    ↓
Webhook verifies signature
    ↓
Creates record in BOTH:
  - In-memory store (for immediate display)
  - Memberstack database (for persistence)
    ↓
GET /api/payments fetches from Memberstack
    ↓
All visitors see the notification (no auth needed)
```

## Public Access Verification

✓ **No login required**: Anyone can visit http://localhost:3000
✓ **No authentication headers**: API calls work without credentials
✓ **Public read access**: Data table is readable by anyone
✓ **Secure writes**: Only backend with admin key can create records

## Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
  - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
  - STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
  - MEMBERSTACK_SECRET_KEY
  - MEMBERSTACK_APP_ID
  - MEMBERSTACK_SHARED_MEMBER_ID
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL
- [ ] Update Stripe webhook URL to production domain
- [ ] Test real payment flow in production
- [ ] Verify notifications appear for all visitors

## Test Conclusion

✅ **All systems operational!**

The public social proof widget is working correctly:
- Shared member account created and configured
- Data table has proper PUBLIC read access
- API endpoints respond correctly
- Frontend displays notifications without authentication
- Ready for production deployment

## Browser Testing

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser:
1. You'll see the payments dashboard (no login needed)
2. Click "Make Test Purchase" or use the Stripe test link
3. Watch the notification appear in real-time
4. Refresh the page - data persists (if saved to Memberstack)
5. Open in incognito/private mode - works the same (public access)
